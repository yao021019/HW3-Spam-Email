## Why

Creating a small CLI tool that scaffolds OpenSpec spec templates from a short prompt will lower the barrier to creating well-formed spec deltas and proposals. Many contributors hesitate because of formatting and required headers. A guided generator reduces friction and enforces required structure.

## What Changes

- Add a new capability: `spec-generator` â€” a small CLI (or script) that scaffolds OpenSpec change directories and spec templates.
- Add `openspec/changes/add-spec-generator/` with proposal, tasks, and delta spec for the new capability.

**BREAKING**: None.

## Impact

- Affected specs: none (new capability).
- Affected workflows: authoring new changes (easier and more consistent output).
- Affected files: new `openspec/changes/add-spec-generator/*` and a new capability spec `openspec/specs/spec-generator/spec.md` once accepted.

## Open Questions

- CLI vs Node script vs GitHub Action? (initial implementation: Node script/CLI).
- Interactive prompts or non-interactive templates? (support both; default interactive)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Proposal and tasks included in `openspec/changes/add-spec-generator/`.
2. A spec delta exists under `changes/add-spec-generator/specs/spec-generator/spec.md` with at least one ADDED requirement and scenarios.
3. Generated templates conform to OpenSpec format (must include `#### Scenario:` headers).
4. `openspec validate add-spec-generator --strict` passes (or shows only accepted warnings).

When approved, implementation should be added in a follow-up change that includes the generator script and tests.
