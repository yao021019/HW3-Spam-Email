This is an updated README containing setup, training, verification, and Streamlit instructions.

(If you prefer this to replace `README.md`, I can rename it or push it as `README.md` if you confirm.)

See `README.md` for the original README. If you want me to push this update to GitHub, reply "push now" and I will attempt to commit & push from this environment and show the output (I'll not expose any secrets).
